Along with providing critical habitat for many economically important and protected species, they also provide critical ecosystem services (including carbon sequestration and wave and storm-surge protection), thus having high economic value. These highly productive ecosystems account for a disproportionately large amount of total organic carbon burial in marine environments compared to their surface area and therefore play an important role in the global carbon cycle (Breithaupt et al. 2012). For this reason, they are often termed ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems as plants remove atmospheric CO2 and sequester it living biomass or soil organic carbon (OC). Among the myriad of global threats to coastal environments, accelerated sea-level rise is perhaps the greatest threat to coastal wetlands. One of the fundamental climate change questions is whether coastal wetland soils will continue to function as a globally significant sink of organic carbon. While changes to precipitation, temperature, cyclone activity, etc. may influence the natural carbon sequestration provided by these ecosystems, the capability to keep pace with sea-level rise (SLR) is perhaps of greatest immediate concern (Ellison and Stoddart 1991). In addition to the threat of SLR simply outpacing current accretion rates, there is the potential for this to be exacerbated in some areas by accelerating soil OC mineralization due to increasing salinity. The increase in salinity supplies sulfate which functions as a terminal electron acceptor that soil microbes can utilize to enhance mineralization in the brackish ecotone regions of coastal wetlands. Coastal wetlands that receive minimal terrigenous sediments are largely dependent on the rate of OC accumulation as a key contributor to accretion (Cahoon and Lynch 1997). Preliminary results from studies of organic carbon burial in wetland soils along the west coast of Florida indicate that accretion rates have not kept pace with the accelerated rate of SLR observed over the last decade. These locations also have substantially lower OC burial rates than systems that are keeping pace with SLR and are located in the ecotone region most susceptible to enhanced OC mineralization. Thus, single values of OC stock and burial with a given system (e.g. the Tampa Bay Estuary) may not be representative of the dynamic variability of carbon dynamics known to occur in coastal wetland soils. It is therefore necessary to measure soil carbon as well as standing biomass in a variety of coastal wetland habitats (mangroves, marshes, salt barrens) to refine estimates of carbon stock and sequestration in the dynamic transitional ecosystems. FORT DESOTO - Ft. De Soto Park is located at the southern tip of Pinellas County and lies adjacent to Tampa Bay to the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the west. The entirety of the project lies within the Tampa Bay Watershed. The planned project consists of two elements aimed at estuary habitat restoration and bay water quality improvement. The first element involves restoring hydrologic flow and circulation between two backwater bays currently blocked by a land bridge formed by the access road to one of the park’s upland islands. Restoring circulation between the two backwater bays will allow better flushing during tidal cycles and improve water quality conditions (such as dissolved oxygen) within these areas.","Indicates that the NEP played a central role in obtaining the leveraging resources","0","0","0","0","0","25","75","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","75000","0","75000","0","-","-","-","-","Region 4","FL","Tampa Bay Estuary Program","APPROVED","APPROVED","Primary","13-AUG-2015 03:24AM","13-AUG-2015 03:24AM"

Advances in habitat restoration and improvements in water quality in Tampa Bay since the 1980s provide a success story in estuarine management. However, Old Tampa Bay has recovered more slowly than other Bay segments with missed water quality targets and declines in seagrass coverage. Since 2000, the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense has bloomed nearly annually in Old Tampa Bay, where its high biomass and cascading effects of low dissolved oxygen, fish kills, and degraded water quality contribute to observed lags in ecosystem and seagrass recovery. Predictions of timing, location, and severity of P. bahamense blooms are needed to identify potential management actions for reducing blooms and improving water quality in Old Tampa Bay. This project will address critical information gaps that impede bloom models. Specifically, P. bahamense produces resting cysts that settle to the seafloor, creating a seed bed that serves to inoculate subsequent blooms. These seed beds are important predictors for when and where blooms will occur, but current estimates of cyst abundance do not take into account cyst maturity, which is a requirement for germination. To develop an empirical formula for quantifying seeding potential, our team of FWRI, USGS, and EPCHC scientists will characterize the distribution of viable, mature cysts in the top layers of sediment and quantify sediment deposition, erosion, and/or mixing processes. Our data on seeding potential, along with information on germination and growth requirements, will be transferred to Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) for incorporation into existing models, so that potential management actions can be identified and evaluated.","Indicates that the NEP played a central role in obtaining the leveraging resources","0","0","0","0","0","100","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","10000","0","10000","0","-","-","-","-","Region 4","FL","Tampa Bay Estuary Program","APPROVED","APPROVED","Primary","13-AUG-2015 02:46AM","13-AUG-2015 02:46AM"
"7165","2015","WQ-1, BH-1","2015 Tampa Bay Environmental Restoration Fund - FDOT","The Fantasy Island Living Shoreline Stabilization Project will create 0.18 acres (enhancing 0.64 acres) of estuarine oyster reef habitat by building 1,220 linear feet of oyster communities using 1,080 oyster domes (Lo-Pro Reef Balls™) and 41.5 tons of fossilized oyster shell. This comprehensive ecosystem restoration method was chosen based on past successful projects at MacDill AFB and around Tampa Bay. Tampa Bay Watch, in partnership with Florida Aquarium and Port Tampa Bay, are confident these measures will accomplish the goals of sediment erosion control and reestablishing a living shoreline on Fantasy Island and will meet the goals outlined by the Comprehensive Conservation & Management Plan which is the governing management plan for Tampa Bay developed by the Tampa Bay Estuary Program. The southern shoreline of Fantasy Island receives extreme wave energy resulting in erosion of existing natural communities. The erosion is caused by increased commercial ship traffic in the main ship channel located to the southwest, as well as strong storm events. Problems associated with erosion affect the native plant species that are anchoring the sediments along this shoreline. This area contains red and black mangroves, palms and many native barrier island plants (seagrape, dune sunflower, railroad vine, privet, etc.) that are being destroyed by powerful wave energy that hits the southern shoreline. Also of concern, is a small rookery located adjacent to the project site on the west side of Fantasy Island. Audubon has monitored breeding activity of Tricolored Heron, Little Blue Heron, Snowy Egret, and Yellow-crowned Night-Heron at this site. Without protection of the native plants, that are stabilizing the shoreline, soil erosion will continue and may result in the loss of critical habitat vital to the rookery and the rookery itself. Oyster construction projects have been essential to restore hard bottom habitats for fish and wildlife resources in Tampa Bay. The Bay has suffered extensive losses of oyster communities not only from human consumption but also from construction activities and road building projects over the last 100 years. Additionally, Hillsborough Bay has suffered from the worst water quality impacts due to the urbanized nature of the embayment, storm water loadings and historical discharges from the largest wastewater treatment plant in the State of Florida. The establishment of an ecosystem-based restoration project along the shoreline of Fantasy Island will enhance and protect local biodiversity through the creation of foraging areas for the many species of fish, birds and other wildlife. Typically oyster communities improve water quality conditions and create calm environments that allow seagrass and salt marsh recovery in the area. Additionally, once the new oyster reefs have matured and the sediments have stabilized, existing salt marsh grasses can continue to expand landward of the new reefs.","Indicates that the NEP played a central role in obtaining the leveraging resources","0","0","0","0","0","0","100","0","0","0","0","0","0","55000","0","0","0","0","0","55000","0","-","-","-","-","Region 4","FL","Tampa Bay Estuary Program","APPROVED","APPROVED","Primary","13-AUG-2015 03:27AM","13-AUG-2015 03:27AM"

The Partnership team will identify the location and extent of transects throughout the Tampa Bay watershed. The coastal habitat transect monitoring program will be integrated into the Tampa Bay Seagrass Interagency Seagrass Monitoring Program which has collected and analyzed seagrass data since 1997 along fixed transects in submerged waters of Tampa Bay. Transect locations will be preferentially selected in areas that contain a continuum of habitats ranging from seagrass to coastal estuarine habitats to upland habitats. The project team will also identify locations for transects in areas that have planned or potential restoration opportunities, utilizing priority sites already identified in the TBHMPU or by project partners. Once the monitoring protocols have been developed and appropriate transect locations have been identified, the team will procure a contractor to conduct the baseline assessment. The environmental contractor, working with the project team, will conduct the baseline assessment, utilizing the protocols developed by the project team, as well as any modifications suggested and approved in the selection process. This will involve on-the-ground surveys of transects in a continuum of habitats. The team and its contractor will also develop a report summarizing current conditions in the Tampa Bay region that will provide a baseline to quantify future changes as a result of global climate change or other impacts. This information will also be included in an electronic database that can be utilized by coastal scientists and managers. Results from this project may help to identify coastal areas in Tampa Bay that may be experiencing rapid or unexpected changes in habitat community structure and/or ecological function, and that may benefit from targeted restoration. This information will be used to prioritize future restoration efforts in the watershed and to leverage funding for restoration in high priority areas.","Indicates that the NEP played a central role in obtaining the leveraging resources","0","0","0","0","0","100","0","0","0","0","0","10000","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","10000","0","-","-","-","-","Region 4","FL","Tampa Bay Estuary Program","APPROVED","APPROVED","Primary","28-JUN-2012 09:52AM","28-JUN-2012 09:52AM"

Since 2000, specialty license plate sales funded more than $1.1M in grants. Bay Mini-Grants must meet at least one of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program’s (TBEP) goals; water quality, habitat restoration, invasive species, public education, fish & wildlife enhancement. Matching funds are not required, but encouraged. In October of each year the program looks to attract projects addressing bay restoration or education in the Tampa Bay watershed. A selection committee composed of members of the TBEP’s Community Advisory Committee (CAC) reviews each proposal and their recommendations are forwarded to the Program’s Management Board and the Policy Boards for final approval. In 2010, $93,000 was awarded to fund 22 grant projects. Prior PCEF award facilitated enhancement of 450 linear feet of shoreline at the Alafia Bank Sanctuary; 107M scallops spawned and released into Lower Tampa Bay to study recovery efforts; several thousand native plants planted and several tons of invasive plants removed at parks and preserves within the watershed.","Indicates that the NEP played a central role in obtaining the leveraging resources","0","50","0","0","0","0","50","0","0","0","0","25000","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","25000","0","-","-","-","-","Region 4","FL","Tampa Bay Estuary Program","APPROVED","APPROVED","Primary","28-JUN-2012 01:00AM","28-JUN-2012 01:00AM"

The results suggest there is no dominant factor controlling seagrass recovery, rather a suite of non-optimal conditions that work synergistically to stress the system. The team recommended a broad-based management approach for nutrients, sediments, pulsed freshwater inputs and toxics. A primary management recommendation was to restore mosquito-ditched mangroves so that water can drain more slowly into the bay and undergo natural treatment. A phased restoration project will consist of: 1. Initial site design and permitting; 2. Restoring natural hydrology of fringing mangrove systems through mosquito-ditch modifications and re-grading to attain correct elevations, restore natural inflow, and improve runoff attenuation runoff by re-routing through enhanced wetland systems; 3. Exotic plant removal/marsh replacement, as necessary adjacent to the mangrove fringe; 4. Salt marsh rehabilitation using community volunteers through the Tampa Bay Watch “Grasses in Classes” program to encourage natural mangrove colonization and additional filtration; 5.

These costive and labor intensive efforts may be inadequate to fully characterize short-term status and long-term trends, and thus could lead to biased statistics and decisions. Our first objective is to improve an existing water quality management decision support system (DSS), namely a water quality decision matrix (WQDM), through use of the latest high spatial-temporal satellite (MODIS and others) observations of Tampa Bay (Florida's largest estuary). Water quality data products of turbidity, clarity (through sechi disk depth or SDD), and sea surface temperature (SST) have been developed and validated for this turbid estuary, while others (concentrations of total suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and light availability for benthos) are to be improved through this project. These remote sensing data products, together with region-specific water quality criteria, will be analyzed for water quality status and trends, and the results will be incorporated in the ongoing monitoring programs and DSS to reduce spatial/temporal aliasing and thus improve DSS performance. Our second objective is to establish a remote sensing based DSS for wider applicability beyond Tampa Bay, by using other estuaries (e.g., Mobile Bay in Alabama) for performance evaluation. This will greatly enhance our current monitoring and management capacity for many estuaries where limited or no in situ effort exists.

It is specifically designed to address one of the priority issues identified by the GOMA Water Quality Priority Issue Team (Action Plan II, 30 June 2008): ""To provide information about coastal water-resource status and trends that support informed management decisions.""

The current condition of the site is a result of the deposition of dredge material from dredging of the adjacent bay bottom to create uplands for residential and agricultural purposes. As a result, the site consists of 25 acres of disturbed (exotic plant species) uplands which were subsequently severely altered by the historic digging of over 225 aquaculture ponds, which were then abandoned. The remainder of the site (18 acres) is comprised of mangrove with relic saltern areas as well as remnant uplands areas (~4 acres) all of which are infested with non-native vegetation. The first task will be to clear the 25 acres areas of the remaining exotic vegetation using heavy machinery, which will commence immediately upon receipt of the NOAA restoration funds. Exotic vegetation within state and federal jurisdictional wetland areas as well as the remnant uplands will be hand-removed. The cleared vegetation will be mulched and recycled onsite as mulching material. The disturbed upland community (~25 acres) will be graded down to estuarine elevations and a portion will also be graded to provide isolated freshwater pools. Once the grades are established the site will be planted with native marsh species; smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), marsh cordgrass (Spartina patens), and seashore Paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum, for the estuarine portions this will allow natural recruitment of red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle). The freshwater pools will be planted with native freshwater vegetation, needle rush (Juncus, spp) sedges (Carex spp), and sawgrass (Caladium), etc. The remaining upland areas will be planted with live oaks (Quercus virginiana) and sabal palms (Sabal palmetto).

Initial mapping and geochemical analyses confirm that a two meter thick accumulation of fine-grained sediments is present in some parts of the study area, and that this material is rich in organic matter and contains metals. Dating, using lead and cesium radioisotope chronologies, indicates that the upper 40 cm of sediment corresponds to the last 100 years of deposition, with the sediment below this level being accumulated prior to 1900 and prior to changes in regional land use and modification of natural hydrologic regimes (i.e., reorientation / facilitation of drainage from the Lake Tarpon watershed). In order to determine whether muck removal is feasible and to determine if removal is necessary for maintaining or improving environmental and recreational conditions, a better understanding of the distribution and origin of the muck is needed.","Indicates that the NEP played a central role in obtaining the leveraging resources","0","0","0","0","0","100","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","94494","0","55000","0","0","0","149494","0","-","-","-","-","Region 4","FL","Tampa Bay Estuary Program","APPROVED","APPROVED","Primary","25-JUL-2007 09:56AM","25-JUL-2007 09:56AM"
